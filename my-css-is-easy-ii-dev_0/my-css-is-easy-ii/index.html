                            Unless you live under one of the few rocks that still lack Internet access, you’ve probably 
                            already heard of an “event queue”. If not, maybe “message queue”, or “event loop”,
                             or “message pump” rings a bell. To refresh your memory, let’s walk through a couple of common manifestations of the pattern.

                        <div class="aside2">

                                For most of the chapter, I use “event” and “message” interchangeably.
                                 Where the distinction matters, I’ll make it obvious.

                            If you&#8217;ve ever done any <span name="event-driven">user interface</span>
                            programming, then you&#8217;re well acquainted with <em>events</em>. Every time the user
                            interacts with your program&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;clicks a button, pulls down a menu, or presses a
                            key&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;the operating system generates an event. It throws this object at your
                            app, and your job is to grab it and hook it up to some interesting behavior.
                        </p>
                        <div class="aside2">
                            <p>
                                <p>This application style is so common, it&#8217;s considered a paradigm: <a
                                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming"><em>event-driven
                                programming</em></a>.</p>
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            In order to receive these missives, somewhere deep in the bowels of your code is
                            an <em>event loop</em>. It looks roughly like this:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code><code style="color: #1481b8">while</code> (running)
{
    Event event = getNextEvent();
    <code style="color: #999">// Handle event...</code>
}
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>
                            The call to <code>getNextEvent()</code> pulls a bit of unprocessed user input into your
                            app. You route it to an event handler and, like magic, your application comes to
                            life. The interesting part is that the application <em id="p3">pulls</em> in the event when
                            <em>it</em> wants it. The operating system doesn&#8217;t just immediately <span
                            name="interrupt">jump</span> to some code in your app when the user pokes a
                            peripheral.
                        </p>
                        <div class="aside2">
                            <p>
                                In contrast, <em>interrupts</em> from the operating system <em>do</em> work like that. When an
                                interrupt happens, the OS stops whatever your app was doing and forces it to
                                jump to an interrupt handler. This abruptness is why interrupts are so hard to
                                work with.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            That means when user input comes in, it needs to go somewhere so that the
                            operating system doesn’t lose it between when the device driver reported the
                            input and when your app gets around to calling <code>getNextEvent()</code>. That
                            “somewhere” is a <em>queue</em>.
                        </p>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When user input comes in, the OS adds it to a queue of unprocessed events. When
                            you call <code>getNextEvent()</code>, that pulls the oldest event off the queue and hands it
                            to your application.

                            Most <span name="game-loop">games</span> aren’t event-driven like this, but it
                            is common for a game to have its own event queue as the backbone of its nervous
                            system. You’ll often hear “central”, “global”, or “main” used to describe it.
                            It’s used for high level communication between game systems that want to stay
                            <span id="p5">decoupled</span>.

                            Say your game has a <span name="tutorial">tutorial</span> system to display help
                            boxes after specific in-game events. For example, the first time the player
                            vanquishes a foul beastie, you want to show a little balloon that says, “Press X
                            to grab the loot!”

                                Tutorial systems are a pain to implement gracefully, and most players will spend
                                only a fraction of their time using in-game help, so it feels like they aren’t
                                worth the effort. But that fraction where they <em>are</em> using the tutorial can be
                                invaluable for easing the player into your game.
                            </p>

                        <p>
                            Your gameplay and combat code are likely complex enough as it is. The last thing
                            you want to do is stuff a bunch of checks for triggering tutorials in there.
                            Instead, you could have a central event queue. Any game system can send to it,
                            so the combat code can add an “enemy died” event every time you slay a foe.
                        </p>
                        <p id="p6">
                            Likewise, any game system can <em>receive</em> events
                            from the queue. The tutorial engine registers itself with the queue and
                            indicates it wants to receive “enemy died” events. This way, knowledge of an
                            enemy dying makes its way from the combat system over to the tutorial engine
                            without the two being directly aware of each other.

                                This model where you have a shared space that entities can post information to
                                and get notified by is similar to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackboard_system">blackboard systems</a> in

                            I thought about using this as the example for the rest of the chapter, but I’m
                            not generally a fan of big global systems. Event queues don’t have to be for
                            communicating across the entire game engine. They can be just as useful within a single class or domain.

                            So, instead, let’s add sound to our game. Humans are mainly visual animals, but
                            hearing is deeply connected to our emotions and our sense of physical space. The
                            right simulated echo can make a black screen feel like an enormous cavern, and a
                            well-timed violin adagio can make your heartstrings hum in sympathetic
                            resonance.

                            and see how it goes. We’ll add a little “audio
                            engine” that has an API for playing a sound given an identifier and a

                                simpler approach and just making the method static.

                            some platform’s real audio API, so I’ll conjure one up that we can presume is
                            implemented elsewhere. Using it, we write our method like so:

                                Where the distinction matters, I’ll make it obvious.

                                This application style is so common, it&#8217;s considered a paradigm: <a
                                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming"><em>event-driven
                                programming</em></a>.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                                In contrast, <em>interrupts</em> from the operating system <em>do</em> work like that. When an
                                interrupt happens, the OS stops whatever your app was doing and forces it to
                                jump to an interrupt handler. This abruptness is why interrupts are so hard to
                                work with.
                            </p>

                                Tutorial systems are a pain to implement gracefully, and most players will spend
                                only a fraction of their time using in-game help, so it feels like they aren’t
                                worth the effort. But that fraction where they <em>are</em> using the tutorial can be
                                invaluable for easing the player into your game.

                                This model where you have a shared space that entities can post information to
                                and get notified by is similar to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackboard_system">blackboard systems</a> in
                                the AI field.

                                While I almost always shy away from the <a href="singleton.html" class="gof-pattern">Singleton</a> pattern, this is one of the places where it
                                may fit since the machine likely only has one set of speakers. I’m taking a
                                simpler approach and just making the method static.
